# Question-3-Chatbot-Development

This repository contains a sample solution for Chatbot-Development Using RAG.

## Quickstart

1. **Prepare Environment:**
    ```bash
    # Install Python 3.9
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Crawling Data:**

    ```bash
    python utils/crawl_data.py https://www.presight.io/privacy-policy.html data/output.md
    ```

3. **Preprocess and Structure Data into a Searchable Index:**
    ```bash
    python utils/generate_embedding.py 
    ```

4. **Using the Chatbot:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py --top_n 3 --history

    --top_n: Number of top references (default is 3). The larger the number, 
    the better the result, but it runs slower and incurs more cost.
    --history: Save chat history, maintain historical context.
